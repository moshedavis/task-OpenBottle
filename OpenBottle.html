  <h1>The art and science of wine-bottle opening - method 1</h1>
  <p>It can be a real bummer to relax in anticipation of filling your wine glass, and to realize that you don't have a corkscrew. Here's a method to remove the cork even without a corkscrew.</p>
  
  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A corked bottle of wine (not a screw cap)</li>
    <li>An impact-absorbing material (for instance, a thick towel or a shoe)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>The procedure</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Remove any foil covering from the cork.</li>
    <li>Wrap the heel (bottom) of the bottle with the shock-absorbing material (for a shoe, place the heel of the bottle in the heel of the shoe).</li>
    <li>With medium force, strike the heel of the bottle repeatedly against a solid structure (such as a wall or tree).</li>
	<li>After about a dozen thumps, you will see the cork slowly popping out of the bottle.</li>
	<li>Repeat until the cork has popped out of the bottle enough to grab it firmly.</li>
	<li>Finish pulling the cork out by hand.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>After all of your effort, relax and enjoy!</p>
